# badtrix
A "bad" c matrix library.


## What is this?
Well..it's a "bad" c matrix library.

### Yeah duh, but why is it bad?
badtrix is bad because low level matrices are such a solved problem ([BLAS](https://www.netlib.org/blas/), [LAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/), [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), etc.) that ever even attempting to make something else can only result in it being a worse product. That's okay though, it's still useful for education, and that's what the goal of badtrix is. If you ever intend to actually use this for anything mission critical...well let's just say it's your funeral.


## Yeah, yeah, yeah, how do I install it?
~~badtrix is basically just some header files, so just add includes~~ I'm actually not sure what to do here yet haha, I'll consider this later down the road.
